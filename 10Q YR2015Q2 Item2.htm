<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We are a holding company operating through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of premium ready-to-drink (&ldquo;RTD&rdquo;) iced tea in the
beverage industry. We are currently organized around our flagship brand Long Island Iced Tea, a premium RTD tea made from a proprietary
recipe and with quality components sold primarily on the East Coast of the United States through a network of national and regional
retail chains and distributors. Our mission is to provide consumers with premium iced tea offered at an affordable price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We aspire to be a market leader in the development of iced tea
beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major target markets for Long Island Iced Tea, consumers
on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families, employees, students and other consumers who lead a
busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules, there is a need for products that are accessible and readily
available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included
in their diets, causing them to shift away from the less healthy options towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, we have begun exploring entry into the $215 billion
U.S. alcohol industry, with the hope to establish ourselves as multi-beverage alcohol and non-alcohol company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">On May 27, 2015, we completed the business combination (the
&ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &ldquo;Merger Agreement&rdquo;),
dated as of December 31, 2014 and amended as of April 23, 2015, by and among Cullen, the Company, Cullen Merger Sub, Inc. (&ldquo;Cullen
Merger Sub&rdquo;), LIBB Acquisition Sub, LLC (&ldquo;LIBB Merger Sub&rdquo;), LIBB, Philip Thomas and Thomas Panza (the &ldquo;Founders&rdquo;),

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, we were a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cullen formed solely for the purpose of consummating the Business Combination, LIBB was a private operating
company and Cullen was a public company seeking alternative strategic opportunities in all industries and regions in an effort
to maximize stockholder value. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we became the new public company and Cullen and LIBB
became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours. In addition, the historical financial statements of LIBB became our financial statements.
As a result of the Business Combination, the business of LIBB became our business.</P>

beverage industry, including most recently serving as Chief Executive Officer of Independent Liquor NZ&rsquo;s businesses in New

over the three months ended June 30, 2014. The primary drivers of these changes were an increase in net sales due to marketing
and sales support efforts, including the development of relationships with new distributors and retailers, and the addition of
gallon containers to our product line, and a decline in our sales to Costco.</TD></TR></TABLE>

2014. Our margin also increased by 7% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014.
The primary reason for the increase was the fact that the Company received a credit of $120,000 from one of the Company&rsquo;s
vendors related to production issues during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in a reduction of the cost of the inventory
affected by the production issues. Our ability to sell this inventory has resulted in improved margins. These positive impacts
were partially offset by the addition of smaller margin gallon containers to the product line.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Company sells products to distributors and in certain cases
directly to retailers, and extends credit, generally without requiring collateral, based on its evaluation of the customer&rsquo;s
financial condition. Potential losses on the Company&rsquo;s receivables are dependent on each individual customer&rsquo;s financial
condition and sales adjustments granted after the balance sheet date. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net
realizable value. Typically, accounts receivable have terms of net 30 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure
to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances
by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables; (2) analyzing its history of sales adjustments; and (3) reviewing its high-risk
customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when the Company&rsquo;s efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the
amount due. Accounts receivable are stated at the amounts management expects to collect.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">For accounting purposes, the Mergers were treated as an acquisition
of Cullen by LIBB and as a recapitalization of LIBB, as the former LIBB members will hold a large percent of the Company shares
and will exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the consolidated entity and the Company was
a public shell company at the time of the transaction. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) 805-10-55-11
through 55-15, the merger or acquisition of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell with nominal assets is
considered a capital transaction in substance rather than a business combination. As a result, the condensed consolidated balance
sheet, statement of operations, and statement of cash flows of LIBB have been retroactively updated to reflect the recapitalization.
Additionally, the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of LIBB are now reflected as those of the Company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased by
$13,212, or 1%, to $940,457 as compared to $927,245 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The primary reason for the increased
sales was the Company&rsquo;s focus on increasing brand recognition and expanding its customer base through the utilization of
new distributors particularly in the New Jersey, Philadelphia, Florida, Virginia, and New England areas. We also began to sell
gallons during May 2015 which contributed to the sales increase. The sales increases resulting from these efforts was offset substantially
by a decrease in our sales to Costco. Sales to Costco declined from approximately 40% of our sales in the prior year as compared
to approximately 8% in the current year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Gross profit increased by $72,801, or 47%, from $155,539 for
the six months ended June 30, 2014 to $228,340 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage increased by 7%
from 17% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 to 24% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase
was due to the fact that the Company received a credit of $120,000 from one of the Company&rsquo;s vendors related to production
issues. The cost of the inventory affected by these production issues was reduced by $91,523 resulting in a positive impact of
$28,477 on our gross profit. The Company maintained this inventory, and as a result, sales of this inventory over the remainder
of this fiscal year could result in a positive impact on our margins which may not be indicative of future results. Our margins
were also positively impacted by the fact that in some regions we were selling directly to retailers which resulted in higher case
prices. These increases in our margins were offset by the sales of our gallon product line, which carries approximately 6% margins
in its initial launch.</P>

June 30, 2015 increased by $159,618, or 35%, to $617,648 as compared to $458,030 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. During
the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company&rsquo;s general and administrative salaries increased by $99,979 as compared to
the six months ended June 30, 2014. This was primarily the result of officers&rsquo; salaries including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. Legal fees increased by $18,775 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 which was
primarily caused by an additional accrual of approximately $42,000 related to the Madwell litigation matter. During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, depreciation expense and amortization increased by $27,175 primarily as a result of the Company&rsquo;s capital
expenditures in 2014 related to displays, trucks, and automobiles. In addition, the Company incurred $39,538 in stock based compensation
expense that was allocated to general and administrative expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2015. These increases were
offset by decreases in accounting fees of $109,246 primarily related to the accounting and audit services needed in the prior year
to prepare for the reverse merger. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was caused primarily by increases
in rent, insurance, and other administrative costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Selling and marketing expenses for the six months ended June
30, 2015 decreased by $756,320, or 55%, to $623,333 as compared to $1,379,653 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Selling and
marketing expenses decreased largely due to decreased advertising expenses from $448,249 for the six months ended June 30, 2014
to $126,493 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. In addition, the costs to perform road shows and product demonstrations, including
staff and sample expenses at these shows, decreased by approximately $213,833 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared
to the six months ended June 30, 2014. This was due to the fact that we performed fewer road shows and product demonstrations during
the period along with the fact that they were mainly staffed in house during the current year. In addition the Company&rsquo;s
selling and marketing expenses decreased due to the fact that the Company changed the style of its labels in 2014. As a result,
design costs decreased by $52,485. There was also a decline in selling salaries of $154,350 during the six months ended June 30,
2015 as compared to the six month ended June 30, 2014 primarily related to cost cutting measures, a commission structure, and fewer
part time workers assisting with the roadshows. Remaining decreases of $13,896 were a result of declines in other promotional expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2015 decreased
by $77,241, or 10%, to $675,735 as compared to $752,976 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The primary reason for the decreased
sales was the decrease in the Company&rsquo;s sales to Costco. Sales to Costco declined from approximately 50% of our sales in
the prior year as compared to approximately 11% in the current year. This was due to the fact that in the prior year, we performed
more road shows and product demonstrations. In addition, in the prior year we were sold in Costco&rsquo;s product line. During
2015, our product was not sold in Costco&rsquo;s regular product line. These sales decreases of approximately $297,000 were offset
by the focus on increasing brand recognition and expanding our customer base through the utilization of new distributors particularly
in the New Jersey, Philadelphia, Florida, and Virginia areas. We also began to sell gallons during May 2015, which contributed
to sales.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Gross profit increased by $35,156, or 29%, from $121,771 for
the three months ended June 30, 2014 to $156,927 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit percentage increased by 7%
from 16% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 to 23% for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The primary reason for the increase
was due to the fact that the Company received a credit of $120,000 from one of the Company&rsquo;s vendors related to production
issues during the first quarter of 2015. The cost of the inventory affected by these production issues was reduced by $91,523.
The Company maintained this inventory, and as a result, our ability to sell this inventory improved our margins. Our ability to
sell this inventory during the remainder of this fiscal year could result in a positive impact on our margins which may not be
indicative of future results. Our margins were also positively impacted by the fact that in some regions we were selling directly
to retailers which resulted in higher case prices. These increases in our margins were offset by the sales of our gallon product
line which carries approximately 6% margins in its initial launch.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">General and administrative expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 increased by $81,551, or 26%, to $398,225 as compared to $316,674 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. During
the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company&rsquo;s general and administrative salaries increased by $53,946 as compared
to the three months ended June 30, 2014. In addition, the Company incurred $39,538 in stock based compensation expense that was
allocated to general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2015. This was primarily the result of
officers&rsquo; salaries including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. Legal fees increased
by $25,525 during the three months ended June 30, 2015 which was primarily caused by an additional accrual of approximately $42,000
related to the Madwell litigation matter. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 depreciation expense and amortization increased
by $8,410 primarily as a result of the Company&rsquo;s capital expenditures in 2014 related to displays, trucks, and automobiles.
These increases were offset by decreases in accounting fees of $100,256 primarily related to the accounting and audit services
needed in the prior year to prepare for the reverse merger. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was caused
primarily by increases in rent, insurance, and other administrative costs.</P>

30, 2015 decreased by $530,866, or 56%, to $415,552 as compared to $946,418 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Selling and
marketing expenses decreased largely due to decreased advertising expenses from $288,232 for the three months ended June 30, 2014
to $116,840 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. In addition, the costs to perform road shows and product demonstrations,
including staff and sample expenses at these shows, decreased by approximately $217,039 for the three months ended June 30, 2015
as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014. This was due to the fact that we performed fewer road shows and product demonstrations
during the period along with the fact that they were mainly staffed in house during the current year. In addition the Company&rsquo;s
selling and marketing expenses decreased due to the fact that the Company changed the style of its labels in 2014. As a result,
design costs decreased by $16,938. There was also a decline in selling salaries of $109,150 during the three months ended June
30, 2015 as compared to the three month ended June 30, 2014. These decreases were offset by increases of $5,656 which was primarily
the result of increased activity at the Company to promote brand awareness and increase LIBB&rsquo;s presence in new markets. Remaining
decreases of $16,347 were a result of declines in other promotional expenses.</P>

Loan&rdquo;) and option agreement (&ldquo;Nortle Option Agreement&rdquo;). The Nortle Loan was secured by the inventory and accounts
receivable of LIBB. The Nortle Loan provided for Nortle to lend the Company an aggregate of $200,000, bearing interest at 6% per
annum. The Nortle Loan and all accrued interest thereon, were due and payable on August 31, 2014. The Nortle Option Agreement provided
that through October 18, 2013, Nortle had the option to loan LIBB an additional $300,000, on the same terms as the Nortle Loan
(&ldquo;Nortle Option&rdquo;). In the event that Nortle did not exercise the Nortle Option by October 18, 2013, then on such date,
the interest rate on the existing loan with Nortle would increase to 12% per annum for the remaining term. Due to the fact that
the Nortle Option to advance additional funds was not exercised, the interest rate was increased to 12% per annum. On June 25,
2014, Nortle converted its loan and accrued interest of $217,951 into equity interests of LIBB.</P>
